[PostCSS Focus Within] lets you use the `:focus-within` pseudo-class in CSS,
following the [Selectors Level 4 specification].

It is the companion to the [focus-within polyfill].

```css
.my-form-field:focus-within label {
  background-color: yellow;
}

/* becomes */

.my-form-field[focus-within] label {
  background-color: yellow;
}

.my-form-field:focus-within label {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

[PostCSS Focus Within] duplicates rules using the `:focus-within` pseudo-class
with a `[focus-within]` attribute selector, the same selector used by the
[focus-within polyfill]. This replacement selector can be changed using the
`replaceWith` option. Also, the preservation of the original `:focus-within`
rule can be disabled using the `preserve` option.
